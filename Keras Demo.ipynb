    "# Part 1: Background \n",
    "\n",
    "## What are neural networks & deep learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll talk about them in class soon! One good source of explanation is: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen Logistic Regression in class. It's like SVM, but with a different loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"perceptron.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "When we used Logistic Regression in class, we classified based on whether the dot product of the example and the weights was *less than 0*. In neural networks this function- which decides whether or not an example is positive based on this dot product- is called an *activation function*. Many neural networks can learn non-linear functions because they use other activation functions such as \"relu\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is made by chaining a few \"neurons\" togther:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"nn.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "What you need to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A neural network is a non-linear classifier, like a decision tree\n",
    "\n",
    "* In practice, they seem to work very well for certain kinds of data including images and text\n",
    "\n",
    "* Neural networks are organized into \"layers\". Lots of choices of how exactly you set up these layer; a \"deep neural network\" is a neural network with many layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A perceptron-like classifier is a very simple neural network (a single-layer neural network neural network)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Keras & what is it used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is a library for deep learning, designed to make common types of neural networks very easy to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's a layer on top of a more powerful, but more difficult to use, library called TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you want to use \"standard\" neural nets, Keras is better; if you want to use very fancy or complicated models you should use Tensorflow.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Tons of examples:\n",
    "https://github.com/fchollet/keras/tree/master/examples\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a model in Keras by specifying which model you want to use, and how you want to train it; Keras takes care of the rest. Keras has many options of \"standard\" models.\n",

    "The state-of-the art accuracy for this dataset is 99.79% accuracy!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-class classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there are 10 labels, we're actually going to need a multi-class classifier.\n",

    "#### Training a 10 way classifier: train 10 binary classifiers\n",
    "What this actually means is we're going to train 10 binary classifier!\n",

    "ie: \n",
    "\n",
    "a \"0 or not 0\" classifier\n",

    "a \"1 or not 1\" classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "a \"2 or not 2\" classifier\n",

    "etc\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing with a 10 way classifier: let all the classifiers \"vote\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, at test time, each classifier \"votes\" and we choose the label based on the \"most confident\" vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "ie, at test time we have an example that is truely a \"1\"\n",
    "\n",
    "the \"0 or not 0\" classifier returns a negative value (meaning \"it's not a 0!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "the \"1 or not 1\" classifier returns **a positive value** (meaning \"it's a 1!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "the \"2 or not 2\" classifier returns a negative value (meaning \"it's not a 2!\")\n",
    "\n",

Here we will use a set of layers that are well adapted to images called convoluational, and pooling layers.  If you are interested in understanding how these work check out this great paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07285.pdf.  For now, you can think of the convlutional layers as learning filter like features of increasing complexity.  We will need to redefine our data in order to work with these layers.  Convolutions work on a matrix of values as opposed to a flattened array, because the filters take into consideration local patterns."
